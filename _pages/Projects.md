- [Minneapolis Crime](https://github.umn.edu/bhatt339/TrendsMarketplace-Team15)


This was the project our team completed for our course in Big Data in Fall 2019. We were looking to predict the number of crimes that would occur for each of the 5 police precincts on a daily level to help improve the number of people staffed on the day.

We used AWS services such as S3 for storage, Comprehend for sentiment analysis, and SageMaker to run our XGboost predictive model. We also used Tableau to dig deeper into the details of what had happened in the past and display geographic information. Our final model resulted in 25% average error (MAPE), cutting the current intuition roughly in half.

- Japan Restaurant Forecasting
  - [Kaggle Post](https://www.kaggle.com/sammusch/kernel4ddef32243)
  - [Github Repository](https://github.com/SamMusch/Predictive-Project-Time-Series)

This was a project we completed for our course in Predictive Analytics (supervised learning) in Fall 2019. We were looking to forecast the number of daily visitors for 150 different restaurants located in different parts of Japan.

Our final model was an ensemble of RNN (sequential neural network model) and LightGBM (faster than XGboost to handle our large dataset).

- [Stedmans Cafe](https://github.com/SamMusch/Stedmans)


This was an undergraduate project to help out the cafe in our Business Administration building. We focused mainly on identifying and promoting high profit margin items. I produced quite a few dashboards [in Tableau](https://github.com/SamMusch/Stedmans/tree/master/Tableau%20Workbooks) to make sure that our analysis was clear for the employees. We also focused quite a bit on setting up templates that future teams would be able to work off of as the data cleaning process was lengthy.
