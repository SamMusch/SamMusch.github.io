I am currently a candidate for a Masters in Business Analytics from the
University of Minnesota and will be graduating in May 2020. I completed my
undergraduate degree in 2019 with a BSBA in Economics.

<br>

I am interested in Data Science / Analysis positions in Minneapolis and
Seattle beginning May 2020.

This site is a portfolio of work that I have completed, and also a personal
reference for myself. The "Projects" link above includes work from my final
year of undergrad through now.
