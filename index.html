I recently graduated from the <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-business-analytics/academics/one-year-msba/program-structure">Masters in Business Analytics</a>
program at the University of Minnesota (May 2020). I graduated from the University of Nebraska Omaha in 2019 with a BSBA in Economics.

This "Projects" link above is a portfolio of work that I have completed from my final
year of undergrad through now.
The other pages are included to demonstrate my background, but mostly
to serve as a personal reference for myself.
