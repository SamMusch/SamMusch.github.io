I am currently a candidate for a <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-business-analytics/academics/one-year-msba/program-structure">Masters in Business Analytics</a>
from the University of Minnesota and will be graduating in May 2020. I completed my
undergraduate degree in 2019 with a BSBA, concentration in Economics.

<br>
<br>

I am interested in Data Science / Analyst positions in
Minneapolis or Seattle beginning June 2020.

This "Projects" link above is a portfolio of work that I have completed from my final
year of undergrad through now.
The other pages are included to demonstrate my background, but mostly
to serve as a personal reference for myself.
