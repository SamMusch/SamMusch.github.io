I am currently a candidate for a [Masters in Business Analytics](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-business-analytics/academics/one-year-msba/program-structure)
from the University of Minnesota and will be graduating in May 2020. I completed my
undergraduate degree in 2019 with a BSBA, concentration in Economics.

<br>
<br>

I am interested in Data Science / Analyst positions in Minneapolis and
Seattle beginning May 2020.

This site is a portfolio of work that I have completed, and also a personal
reference for myself. The "Projects" link above includes work from my final
year of undergrad through now.
